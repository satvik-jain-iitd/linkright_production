# Changelog

All notable changes to LinkRight will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-03

Pillar 2 + Pillar 3 push toward v1 ship. New `linkright watch` (Chrome-attached
passive job-page capture across 7 portals), Pillar 2 dual-read jobs feed,
optional resume brand-color design, and Story Bank for STAR-format career
narratives.

> **Note on prior versions**: 0.2.x (Pillar 2 v1 — auth + jobs CLI thin client)
> and 0.3.0 (cover letter sub-tool) were released without CHANGELOG entries.
> See PR history (#48, #49) for those changes.

> **NOTICE — visual change for existing users**: default brand colors flipped
> from navy palette (`#1B2A4A` etc.) to pure `#000000`. If you previously ran
> `linkright resume tailor` and got navy section titles + bullet markers, the
> output is now genuinely B&W. Opt back into color via the new `linkright
> resume brand` subcommand.

### Added
- **`linkright watch`** — passive job-page capture via Chrome DevTools Protocol
  (Sprint D). Attaches to user's existing Chrome profile, listens for navigation
  to job pages, extracts JD + posts to `/api/captures` on the LinkRight backend.
  7 portals supported: LinkedIn, Naukri, Indeed, Wellfound, Greenhouse, Lever,
  Ashby. Subcommands: `watch` (foreground), `watch setup` (Chrome remote-debug
  setup), `watch service` (background daemon), `watch status` (one-shot health
  check), `watch list` (recent captures from Oracle PG). Per-source path
  blocklist prevents accidental private-page captures.
- **Pillar 2 dual-read** — `linkright jobs find` now merges Supabase scored
  feed + Oracle PG captures. Captures surface in the same view alongside
  scored recommendations; user sees their just-captured Naukri/LinkedIn
  postings without waiting for the next ranking job.
- **Sprint B trigger on captures** — new captures trigger fire-and-forget
  slug auto-discovery on previously-unknown companies (FastAPI BackgroundTasks +
  asyncpg). Companies database grows organically as user browses; no manual
  curation required.
- **Optional brand-color design** — `linkright resume brand --run-id <id>
  --primary "#..." [--secondary] [--accent] [--cover-letter <path>]` re-renders
  a tailored resume + cover letter with company-branded metric bolds and
  section-divider gradient. Pure B&W default unchanged. Surgical CSS swap on
  the rendered HTML; auto-bolds metric tokens (`$X`, `X%`, `XK/M/B`, `Xx`,
  `X:Y`, time units, `+`) in cover letter prose.
- **Pillar 3 Story Bank** — new `career_stories` MongoDB collection +
  `linkright stories` CRUD CLI (list / add / edit / delete / search) with
  STAR-format fields, tags, JD-requirement linkages. `--from-nugget`
  pre-fills `result` from existing resume nuggets (Truth Engine compliant —
  no LLM fabrication, scaffold only). `linkright interview prep` reads
  the Story Bank, merging legacy `user_context` debriefs as ranked-lower
  fallback. Shipped in PR #62.
- **Sprint C Phase 1** — `/api/captures` POST endpoint backed by Oracle PG
  `job_discoveries` table; Tampermonkey userscript path for browser-extension
  capture (deprecated by `watch` but retained for reference).
- **Oracle Postgres bring-up** — `companies` schema, slug-discovery cache,
  enriched-jobs cache. 81-company seed (28 ATS-verified). Sprint B 3-tier slug
  auto-discovery code: Layer 1 (known-pattern) and Layer 2 (page-fetch) are
  fully wired in production; Layer 4 (self-heal validator) code is merged
  but its Oracle VPS cron / systemd schedule has not yet been deployed
  (see Known limitations).

### Changed
- `linkright resume tailor` default brand colors flipped from navy palette
  (`#1B2A4A`) to pure `#000000` — output is genuinely B&W unless user opts
  into branding via the new `brand` subcommand.
- 4-stop hard-edge section divider gradient → 3-stop smooth linear gradient.
- All 4 templates: section title color + bullet markers locked to black
  regardless of brand opt-in.
- Watchlist UX demoted from mandatory onboarding to optional power-feature
  (docs only — code unchanged).
- `linkright stories` retrieval merges `career_stories` + legacy
  `user_context.kind=story` rows; previous all-or-nothing precedence
  (which silently dropped debriefs after first story) replaced.

### Fixed
- `asyncio.run` guards in `_run_watch_default` + `status_cmd` — unguarded
  exceptions previously bubbled as raw Python tracebacks instead of one-line
  actionable error messages.
- Per-source `BLOCKED_PATH_PATTERNS_BY_SOURCE` dict (vs global blocklist) —
  ATS sources (greenhouse / lever / ashby) intentionally exempt from LinkedIn-
  private-page regex that would silently 403 captures whose tenant slug
  collides with private path names.
- `apply_brand_to_html` regex preserves `!important` and inline comments
  after hex values; previously silently no-op'd on those CSS qualifiers.
- `linkright stories edit` strips whitespace + validates non-empty title /
  action / result before save; previously could write corrupt documents
  via prompt-clear.
- `(user_id, title)` unique index on `career_stories` blocks duplicate-title
  ambiguity at insert time.

### Known limitations
- Manual QA pass before public release (see
  [`specs/manual-qa-plan-v1-2026-05-03.md`](../../specs/manual-qa-plan-v1-2026-05-03.md)).
- `linkright resume brand --auto` (admin DB lookup) deferred to a follow-up release.
- Tailor pipeline doesn't yet surface `career_stories` alongside nuggets
  in step_08 retrieval. Deferred to v0.5 — needs proper RCA evaluation
  on bullet-quality per memory `feedback_one_resume_at_a_time` before
  prompt-context wiring lands.
- Layer 4 self-heal validator: code merged (admin CLI subcommand
  available as `linkright admin slug-discovery validate-all [--max N]`),
  but Oracle VPS cron / systemd schedule for nightly automatic runs has
  not yet been deployed. Until then, run the validator manually.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-24

First agent-native release. Four-pillar CLI + MCP server, local-first data layer.

### Added
- Agent-native CLI with 4 pillars: `resume`, `jobsearch`, `interview`, `content`
- 16-step resume tailoring pipeline (ported iter-02 → iter-08 quality work)
- Per-session MCP server (FastMCP) exposing **8 resume tools**
- LLM cascade: **Groq → Gemini Flash Lite → Cerebras → OpenRouter** + Oracle `gemma3:1b` for local fallback
- MongoDB local data layer — **12 collections**, v2-ready schema
- A–F 10-dim scorecard + telemetry loop (`CONTINUOUS_RCA_LOG.md`)
- `.claude/skills/` auto-discovery (8 skills: tailor-resume, score-resume, batch-apply, profile-refresh, evaluate-jd, interview-prep, draft-posts, content-plan)
- Idempotent `linkright init` — bootstraps `~/.linkright/` + Mongo collections + vector indexes
- Ops commands: `init`, `mcp serve`, `profile import`
- Legacy v0.0 commands preserved: `optimize`, `validate`, `assisted`

### Known issues
- Pillar 1 orchestrator E2E untested (requires API keys + sample resume/JD)
- Scorers are heuristic — LLM-judged scoring deferred to v0.2
- Pillars 2–4 are thin slices, not iter-08 quality yet
- Vector search falls back to cosine-scan on local MongoDB CE (Atlas-only feature)
